1. Introduction

We can reduce the barrier to entry on doing async-parallel computing. The users of the pkg
only need to know a few concepts of classic optimization formulations and algorithms.
Meaning that the users only needs to know how to implement the CU for their application.

We provide a set of common examples.

The package provide serial functionality and does parallel programming automatically.

A library of operators have been implemented.

(Check the paper from Boyd A primer on monotone operator theory for the transition sentence)

2. Quick-Start Section
   1) installation;
   2) command line;
   3) the app file;
   TODO: need to figure out a way to transite to the next section.


3. Syntax
      Brief explanation of components
      forward operator -> gradenite step
      backward operator -> prox
      fbs -> particular composition of two operators -> prox gradient
      why call it fbs instead of prox gradient -> fixed point framework
      other generic composition rules exist -> read following resources
      

4. Numerical Results

We should add LP, SOCP when we get time.
