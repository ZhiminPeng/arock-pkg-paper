\section{Conclusion}
We have developed \pkg, an easy-to-use open source toolbox for large scale optimization problems.
The toolbox implemented both sequential and parallel algorithms based on operator splitting methods, stochastic methods,
and coordinate update methods. The architecture of \pkg~is separated into several layers and mimics how a scientist writes down an optimization algorithm. Therefore, it is easy for one to obtain a new algorithm by modifying just one of the layers such as adding a new operator.

\pkg~is still being improved by new research results. New applications will be added to the package. The software and user guide \repo~ will be kept up-to-date and supported.
