%% abstract
\begin{abstract}
MOTAC is a toolbox written in C++11 that implements algorithms based on a set of modern methods for large-scale optimization. It covers a variety of optimization problems, which can be both smooth and nonsmooth, convex and nonconvex, as well as constrained and unconstrained. The algorithms implemented in MOTAC, such as the coordinate update method and operator splitting method, are scalable as they decompose a problem into simple subproblems. These algorithms can run in a multi-threaded fashion, either synchronously or asynchronously. The architecture of MOTAC is separated into several layers and mimics how a scientist writes down an optimization algorithm. Therefore, it is easy for one to obtain a new algorithm by modifying just one of the layers such as adding a new operator.
