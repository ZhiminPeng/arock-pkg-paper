\section{Numerical experiments}
In this section, we illustrate the efficiency of \pkg~for three applications: $\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, portfolio optimization,  and nonnegative matrix factorization. The tests were carried out on a machine with 64GB of memory and two Intel Xeon E5-2690 v2 processors (20 cores in total).
