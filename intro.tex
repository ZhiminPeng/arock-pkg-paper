\section{Introduction}
The fixed-point problem is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fix_point_set}
\cT x = x
\end{equation}

Major details are
\begin{itemize}
\item list of current popular algorithms are coordinate based (sequential and parallel, asynchronous).
\item there is no framework for rapid prototyping of these algorithms, list existing code for doing coordinate update;
\item state fixed-point problem, steel some introduction from CF-paper;
\item We are releasing a unified framework for rapid prototyping of serial, sync-parallel and async-parallel coordinate algorithms;
\item It is simple enough that an undergraduate can implement it. 
\item Matlab interface is forth coming;
\end{itemize}
